# study-notes
This repository contains notes on various courses given in NRU ITMO.
Reading `.org` files is much simpler when using emacs + org.

Please contribute, especially if you have:
  * Found any semantic errors
  * Found any typos/misspellings
  * Found some too informal text that should be deleted (I'm sorry for that)
  * Used this repo and it helped you a lot (I'd be really grateful for any additions/fixes/improvements)
